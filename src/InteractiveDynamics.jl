@warn("InteractiveDynamics is deprecated.
The packages that used it (DynamicalSystems.jl, Agents.jl, DynamicalBilliards.jl)
have all moved to using Julia package extensions and hosting the plotting code themselves.
Simply move to Julia 1.9+, uninstall InteractiveDynamics, and follow the latest
stable documentation of the package you are interested in.")
