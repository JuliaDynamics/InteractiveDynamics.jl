# # Interactive GUIs for Dynamical Systems

# Via the package [InteractiveDynamics.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/InteractiveDynamics.jl/dev/)
# we have created several simple GUI applications for exploring dynamical systems
# which are integrated with [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/).
# The GUI apps use the [Makie](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/) ecosystem,
# and have been designed to favor generality and simple source code.
# This means that even if one of the available GUI apps does not do what you'd like to
# do, it should be easy to copy its source code and adjust accordingly!
